🌵 [github.com/needle-tools](https://github.com/needle-tools) and [needle.tools](https://needle.tools) - Tailor-Made Tools for Creators.  
*We have a lot of open source repositories there. Mainly for Unity but some are more general purpose.*

🛡️ [github.com/needle-mirror](https://github.com/needle-mirror) - Mirrored Versions of packages available in UPM, without any changes.  
*We run a couple of bots and services that update the github repositories whenever Unity publishes a new package version. There's also [this twitter bot](https://twitter.com/Needle_Mirror) that posts package releases but also about Editor releases*
